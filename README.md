## My Task

<br>

 To create a weather application using the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities while featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS

<br>

## User Story

<br>

AS An aspiring web developer

I WANT to create a weather application for users to see current and forecasted weather updates of multiple cities

SO THAT users can access accurate weather updates for the cities they searched 

<br>

## Client User Story

## What I Accomplished

<br>

* Page loads to the input field where the user can search and submit the city of their choosen
<br>

* When the user searches for a city they are presented with the current and future conditions for that city and that search gets added as a button in the search history section
<br>

* In the current weather card, the section displays the name of the city, date, and the weather icon. Below the header section for the card lies the current temperature for that city, wind speed, humidity, and the UV Index. 
<br>

* In the forecast section there are 5 cards which displays the weather forecasted 4 days ahead of the current date. In each of the cards displays the predicted temperature, wind, and humidity. 
<br>

* When a user looks at the UV Index, they see a conditional color for that data so the user knows that green means favorable, yellow means moderate, and red means harsh. 
<br>

* When a user clicks the previously saved button for a particular city then they are presented again to the current and future conditions for that city.
